          Finding the perfect wording for your mission statement can be a
          challenge. To give you some inspiration, here are some examples
          readers have shared with me: “To inspire positive change through
          teaching and coaching.” “To create opportunities for today’s youth.”
          “To encourage, engage, and equip others to believe in the
          possibilities.” “To positively impact the life of every person I
          meet.” “To encourage everyone I interact with on a daily basis.” And,
          of course, my personal mission statement…“To help others live the
          lives they would if they only knew how.”
